<h2>About Auto Certificate</h2>
<p>Have you wondered how you get your certificate when you complete an online course?</p>
<p> Is there a team that writes the certificate for each student after they finish the course?</p>
<p>Well... if that is the case that will cost a lot and be an overwhelming thing.</p>
<p>Actually when you finish an online course they don't write you a certificate manually they instead use Auto Certificate.</p>
<p>Witch is a software that prints your certificate automatically and it will need three things (depending on how much info you want to add) which is your name, course name, and the date you finished the course </p>
<p>This data can be obtained from a database or can be written as this project does for simplicity and clarify</p>
